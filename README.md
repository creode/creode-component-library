# Creode Component Library
This component library is built using Vanilla JS, ScSS and HTML elements. It is designed to be lightweight and mostly used for keeping versions of snippets that we would use on various websites.

## Docs
The docs folder is maintained by a Github action that runs on every push to the release (e.g. main, 2.x etc.) branch. The README.md and index.html files can be changed a dev however all other files will be rebuilt and dynamically generated on each merge to the release (e.g. main, 2.x etc.) branch. The action will build the docs folder and push it to the gh-pages branch. This will then be available at [https://creode.github.io/components.creode.co.uk/](https://creode.github.io/components.creode.co.uk/).
